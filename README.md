# groupme-analysis

A suite of functions to extract statistics about your GroupMe group chat

## Running the program

This program works with GroupMe data in JSON format, which is gathered through 
the GroupMe API. I used a tool called [groupme-tools](https://github.com/cdzombak/groupme-tools) 
by cdzombak on GitHub, which I highly recommend.

## Requirements

Works with Python 3.x, not 2.x

However, in its current form, this program could probably be edited to work with 
Python 2.x very easily
